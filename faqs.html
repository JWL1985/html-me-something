            <h3>How Long Does It Take To Get Your License?</h3>
                <p>
                    The reqired classroom work takes 2 weeks, plus another few days to complete the 24hr online course.  After that, you can study and take the state 
                    exam as soon as you are ready.  If you choose to complete the required 72 hrs of classroom work online, rather than the in-class setting, you can go at 
                    your own pace but for most people it usually takes a little longer to complete online classes.
                </p>
            <h3>What if I fail the State exam?</h3>
                <p>
                    You can retake the test as many times as you want but it costs $68 each time.
                </p>
