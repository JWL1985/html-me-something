            <p>Real Estate can be a great investment, and its definitely something we ALL need.
            whether you rent or own, everyone needs a roof over their head.  Just because the
            industry is huge doesn't mean its easy for an agent to make a living.  It can be an exciting 
            career but it certainly has its fair share of challenges, especially in the begining.
            In this article I'll go over some pros & cons about being a Real Estate Agent
            in 2019.

                    <h1>My Journey</h1>
                    <h2>In The Beginning...</h2>
                    <p>
                            As a kid, I grew up in the South County suburbs of St. Louis.  My mom worked in the 
                        cosmetic industry and my dad was a superintendent for a large-scale commercial construction
                        company.  I attended public school and for all intensive purposes I had a pretty "normal" 
                        upbringing.  From a young age I always wanted to make a lot of money but I never really knew
                        exactly what I wanted to do.  In middle school and high school, my main focus was on sports and 
                        although I did well in school I was never that genuinely interested in much of what I learned 
                        in school.  I was big into skateboarding, ice hockey, soccer and eventually played lacrosse 
                        in high school as well.  I held down a few random jobs at Subway and Bed Bath & Beyond in addition 
                        to starting a very small scale lawn business with a buddy of mine.  We would load up a couple of 
                        push-mowers in the back of my Ford Explorer and hand out flyers, ultimately locking down about 10 or 15
                        mowing accounts for the summer.  Senior year of high school I graduated a semester early and my 
                        dad got me in the Laborers Union (local 42 if I remember correctly) and I worked for him that 
                        last semester and summer before college.  This was great as I was making $25/hr which was a HUGE amount
                        of money for me.  I learned a lot in this 8 month period and saved up a nice little chunk of money for 
                        my upcoming Fall semester at MIZZOU.

                    <h2>The Lawn Business</h2>
                    <p>
                            My time at MIZZOU was great and for the first couple of years I would come home and continue 
                        working with my dad during the summers.  But during my junior year, myself and another friend decided we 
                        wanted to start a 'real' lawn business.  We each had about $4000 saved up and were also able to borrow a little 
                        from our parents so we could buy a nice commercial lawn-mower, a truck and some other misc. equipment.  We hit 
                        it hard that first year and landed about 35 routine lawn mowing accounts.  After that first year, my friend 
                        decided he wanted out of the lawn business so he could move back to St. Louis but I decided to stay in Columbia 
                        and continue to operate the business... I had no idea I would stay in Columbia and certainly never planned on 
                        it but I enjoyed running the business and LOVED being my own boss so I ended up owning and operating that business
                        for the next 10 years until 2016 when I sold the company to another local compettitor.

                    <h2>Real Estate Career Begins</h2>
                    <p>
                            While running the lawn business I met and worked for a lot of big property owners.  I knew early on that I wanted to 
                        own and manage rental properties myself, my new goal was to have enough rental properties to be able to eventually 
                        retire on that income.  So naturally when I sold the business in 2016, I decided to buy a few rental properties.  This was 
                        but I als realized very quickly that I would need a steady income to be able to continue buying properties so I decided to 
                        get my real estate license and start working as a buyers/sellers agent.  So.. two and a half years later and I am still working 
                        as an agent as well as buying/selling/flipping houses as an investor.  To be 100% honest, I like the investor side of things 
                        much more than the 'agent' side of things.  I've managed to provide a descent living for myself these last few years and also 
                        build some equity in my investments but I have also come to realize that working as a real estate agent is NOT what I want to 
                        do forever.  In the sections below, I will discuss some of the pros & cons about being a real estate agent based on my experience.

               <p>
                    This is a question I have struggled with over the last few years but now the answer seems obvious.  After completing unit 1 of <a href= "https://www.launchcode.org" target= "_blank">LaunchCode</a> there is no doubt in my mind 
                that I have chosen the right path.  I am enjoying learning 'to code' and all things related and I am looking forward to continue on this learning path and getting a job in this field. Hopefully, in addition to doing work that I really enjoy, I can also make a lot of $$, &cent;, &pound;, &yen; and &euro;&apos;s.
